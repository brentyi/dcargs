The core functionality of `dcargs` — generating argument parsers from type
annotations — can be found as a subset of the features offered by many other
libraries. A summary of some distinguishing features:

Note that most of these other libraries are generally aimed specifically at
_dataclasses_ rather than general typed callables, but offer other features that
you might find useful, such as registration for custom types (`pyrallis`),
different approaches for serialization and config files (`tap`, `pyrallis`),
simultaneous parsing of multiple dataclasses (`simple-parsing`), etc. Pull
requests are welcome if you're missing any of these. :slightly_smiling_face:
